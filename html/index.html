<h1>DNSSEC for tinydns</h1>

<p>
This project adds DNSSEC support to D. J. Bernstein's
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html">tinydns</a>.
</p><p>
It consists of two parts (mostly):
</p>
<ul>
<li>tinydns-sign, a perl script for augmenting a tinydns-data file with
  DNSSEC-related RRs, and</li>
<li>a patch to tinydns / axfrdns to make them produce DNSSEC-authenticated
  answers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The patch tries to preserve the behaviour of tinydns/axfrdns wrt non-DNSSEC
queries, with three noteworthy exceptions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The interpretation of wildcard records now matches the description in
  <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034">RFC-1034</a> section 4.3.3.
  Specifically, if there's a wildcard *.x and a
  record for a.x, then a query for y.a.x will <b>not</b> be answered using the
  wildcard (for a label 'a' and series of labels 'x' and 'y').<br>
  This change is required for signed domains, because authentication of
  negative responses requires a common understanding between client and
  server about the meaning of wildcards.</li>
<li>EDNS0 in queries will be honoured also for non-DNSSEC queries, i. e.
  tinydns may produce answers exceeding 512 bytes. (There is a hard
  limit of 4000 bytes, though.)<br>
  This <b>can</b> lead to problems on IPv6 networks.</li>
<li>TXT records are split into character-strings of 255 bytes, not 127.
  This is not really a DNSSEC-related change, but this is kind of a FAQ and
  tinydns-data and tinydns-sign must agree on how this is handled or the
  generated RRSIG won't match.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Be careful with publishing signed zones as a secondary nameserver: the
modified tinydns/axfrdns require certain helper RRs in the database to
simplify locating NSEC3 records. Without these helpers, tinydns cannot
generate valid negative response nor valid wildcard responses.
</p><p>
Axfrdns <b>will</b> publish these helper RRs, other primaries will most
likely <b>not</b>.
